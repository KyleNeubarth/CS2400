A place for all of my labs in Computer Systems, CS2400 at CU Boulder

A lot of these files are drivers and test cases provided by the class for the lab.

BombLab: figure out the required inputs by disassembling an executable bomb program
AttackLab: use buffer overflow attacks and widgets to execute unintended code
PerformanceLab: increase the performance of a image filtering program
ShellLab: build a functioning unix shell with basic commands
Malloc Lab: create program for basic memory allocation

If you want to look at my code, check out these files:

- PerformanceLab\perflab-setup\FilterMain.cpp

- MallocLab\malloclab-handout-segregated\mm.c

- ShellLab\shlab-handout\tsh.cc
